/**
 * server/src/services/paymeService.ts
 *
 * Business logic for organization wallet top-ups via PayMe. Rewritten
 * from scratch for the wallet flow (see SCRUM-257) - not a merge of the
 * old feature/payment-payme branch, which targeted user subscriptions
 * and had the bugs listed in SCRUM-254 (success/succeess mismatch that
 * made /initiate always fail, an inverted StatusCode check that treated
 * successful payments as failed, no webhook signature check, no
 * idempotency, no amount verification). None of that is reused here.
 *
 * Rewritten a second time after confirming PayMe's actual, documented
 * API shape (https://docs.payme.io/docs/payments): the first version of
 * this file guessed at a callback payload shape (StatusCode/TransactionId/
 * Amount/MoreData) that does not match PayMe's real Sale Callback
 * attributes (status_code/notify_type/transaction_id/price/payme_transaction_id).
